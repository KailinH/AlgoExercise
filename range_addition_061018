range addition, lintcode
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.
Given:
length = 5,
updates = 
[
[1,  3,  2],
[2,  4,  3],
[0,  2, -2]
]
return [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
